# What is Ameelio?

> Ameelio is a nonprofit technology company committed to transforming the criminal justice system. Make video calls, send e-messages and physical letters, find support, and explore data for free.

Our goal is to transform the way people communicate with their loved ones on the *inside* and *outside*. Traditionally, companies such as **Global Tel Link** and **Securus Technologies** have made enormous profits by managing inmate communication. They charge outrageous sums to people who have been impacted by the Prison Industrial Complex, including the incarcerated, their friends and their family.

Our goal is to make the service and technology for communication **free**. In the spirit of *Free Education*, *Free Information* and *Open Source*, we aim to create a platform that can break the hold that these companies have over us.
