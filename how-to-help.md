# How can you help?

We have various projects that need assistance. As we work to establish a consistent workflow for each project, communication is key. To contribute, you should first join Slack, after reading the [Project Overview](overview.md) document.

## Join Slack

[Slack Invite Link](https://join.slack.com/t/ameelioorg/shared_invite/enQtNzkwMzAwNjkzMjk5LTcwMmI5M2VlMGQ3ZjRmMWE5MzI5NDliOGMwNzFmYjdjYTFlMzdmYjgxNTY2ODMxYjQwZWQ4NTU2NDVjZTc4ZGE)

Use this invite link to join our Slack community. From there, there are channels for each project that is active in development as well as a `#general` channel for general Ameelio discussion.

From there, you can introduce yourself, ask questions and we'll be there to respond. If you'd like to contribute to a specific project or would like more information before you make a decision, then let us know! We will do our best to help you get started.

## Find us on GitHub

Our GitHub organization can be found [here](https://github.com/AmeelioDev). There you can see a list of our projects and you can view current issues in each individual repositories issue tracker. There you can see what needs to be done or even submit your own issue if you found a bug or would like to see functionality added to one of those applications.
